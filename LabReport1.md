A sentence or two explaining why you got that output (e.g. what was in the filesystem, what it meant to have no arguments).
Indicate whether the output is an error or not, and if it’s an error, explain why it’s an error.

Working Directory: Home.
Typing in cat without any arguments does not tell the computer what file that I am looking or want to create. However, it does not appear to be an error.

using cat as a command here works because I am specifying what directory or file I want to view.

This image above contains the three scenarios as provided, cd without an argument, cd with a path to a directory as an argument, and cd with a path to a file as and argument. For cd with no argument, the working directory was /Users/virajchandra which was the parent directory. this means that cd generally without any arugments, goes to the root, but since we were at the root already, nothing happened. When passing the a directory path as an argument(Users/virajchandra/Desktop/wavelet), it changed to the directory as expected. However, (Users/virajchandra/Desktop/wavelet/Server.java) caused an error because we cannot change directory into a file.
