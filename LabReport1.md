Typing in cat without any arguments does not tell the computer what file that I am looking or want to create. However, it does not appear to be an error.

typing in cd lecture1 does change the directory to lecture1, instead of home, because we passed lecture1 as the argument for cd.

This did cause an error because files are not directories. I cannot change directory to a file, only to a folder.

There is no problem or error here because ls is simply just relisting the pathway that we took to get to the specific file.
