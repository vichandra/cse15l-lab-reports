A screenshot or Markdown code block showing the command and its output
What the working directory was when the command was run
A sentence or two explaining why you got that output (e.g. what was in the filesystem, what it meant to have no arguments).
Indicate whether the output is an error or not, and if it’s an error, explain why it’s an error.

when typing in change directory, I did not get any errors, but nothing happened. this is because I did not specify what directory that I want to change to.

typing in ls did not cause any error, as it listed all the directories or files located within the directory that I was in. It did what it was told.

Typing in cat without any arguments does not tell the computer what file that I am looking or want to create. However, it does not appear to be an error.

ls lecture one works because the directory is specified so it lists all the files and directories within lecture1

using cat as a command here works because I am specifying what directory or file I want to view.

using cat as a command here works because I am specifying the exact file I want to view.

This did cause an error because files are not directories. I cannot change directory to a file, only to a folder.

There is no problem or error here because ls is simply just relisting the pathway that we took to get to the specific file.
