Hi, I am working on String reverser that is meant to reverse a string but there appears to be an out of bounds of error. the output gives me bunch of errors, as well as saying index out of bounds. I feel that it might have to with an error of assigning the the new indices of the reversed string.


Hi, I've been working on a Java program that's supposed to reverse a string, but it's not working as expected. I've attached a screenshot of the output. The program should reverse the word "hello", but the output is strange. I think the issue might be in the reverseString method, but I'm not sure why it's not reversing correctly.

TA: 
 It seems like there might be an issue with how you created the reversed string. Try adding print statements inside your reverseString method to see the value of reversed after each iteration. This can give you a clue about how the string is being reversed. (Hint: think about how many times the forloop is running)
